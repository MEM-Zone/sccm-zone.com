## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/mazgi/hugo-theme-techlog-simple.git

## Getting started

After installing the theme successfully it requires a just a few more steps to get your site running.

### The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/mazgi/hugo-theme-techlog-simple/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](https://github.com/mazgi/hugo-theme-techlog-simple/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml). To use it, copy the [`config.toml`](https://github.com/mazgi/hugo-theme-techlog-simple/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) in the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to change the strings in this theme.

### Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

`$ hugo server`

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313/) in the address bar of your browser.

To run in production (e.g. to have Google Analytics show up), run `HUGO_ENV=production` before your build command. For example:

```shellsession
$ HUGO_ENV=production hugo
```
