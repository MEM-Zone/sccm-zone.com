Some text, and some `code` and then a nice plain [link with title](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/davidhampgonsalves.com-hugo "title text!").

  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at

vs.

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

## Code

Inline `code`

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
