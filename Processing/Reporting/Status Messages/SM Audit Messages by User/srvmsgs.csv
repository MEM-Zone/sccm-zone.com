"1200","In the last %1 hours, Status Manager processed %2 status messages.Of these, %3 were written to the site database, %4 were replicated to the parent site, %5 were reported as Windows Events on the site server, and %6 were passed as command-line parameters to external programs. During this time, Status Manager received %7 corrupt files that contained one or more status messages that could not be processed. Also during this time, Status Manager used %8 hours of CPU time, which represents a %9 percent utilization of the total CPU time available for the period.Status Manager periodically reports this message for your convenience; you can ignore it if your not interested in monitoring Status Manager's processing performance. Status Manager will report this message again in %10 hours.","Informational"
"1201","Status Manager successfully initialized the ""SMS Status Messages"" performance object. Every time Status Manager receives a status message it will update the performance counters contained by this performance object. You can measure Status Manager's processing performance by monitoring this performance object with the Windows Performance Monitor. For example, you can monitor the total number of status messages written to the site database by Status Manager by monitoring the ""_Total"" instance of the ""Written To SMS Database"" counter. Status Manager resets all of the counts when it is restarted, and the counts cannot be viewed when Status Manager is not running.","Informational"
"1203","Status Manager successfully initialized an in-memory queue to forward status messages to the summarizer component %1. The summarizer distills the stream of status messages into a high-level summary, which you can view under the System Status node of the Configuration Manager Console. You can monitor the performance of the in-memory queue in the Windows Performance Monitor by selecting the ""SMS In-Memory Queues"" performance object, and then selecting the instance for this summarizer. For example, the ""Total Objects Enqueued"" counter tells you how many status messages Status Manager has forwarded to the summarizer. The counts are reset when both Status Manager and the summarizer are restarted, which typically occurs when SMS Executive is restarted. The counts cannot be viewed when Status Manager and the summarizer are both not running.","Informational"
"1204","Status Manager will no longer forward status messages to the summarizer component %1 because the summarizer was disabled. The summarizer distills a stream of status messages into a high-level summary, which you can view under the System Status node of the Configuration Manager Console.

(Note that for display purposes, the program and command-line arguments were truncated to %3 characters in this message.) Status Manager successfully started the program, but the program was still running after 60 seconds.Possible cause: The Status Filter Rule specifies a program that runs interactively and the program will not exit until it receives user input. This would happen, for example, if you specified ""notepad.exe"" as the program.Solution: First correct the Status Filter Rule to specify a program that runs to completion without requiring user input; this is done by editing the Program box on the Actions tab of the Status Filter Rule Properties page in the Configuration Manager Console. (Note that you are not limited to %3 characters in the Program box.) Then verify that the old program is not still running on the site server using the Windows Task Manager. If the old program is still running, use End Process in Task Manager to stop it.Possible cause: The Status Filter Rule specifies a program that takes a long time to run.Solution: Ignore this message, but consider changing the Status Filter Rule to specify a program that runs quickly. Slow programs, when executed frequently, will slow down the rate at which Status Manager can process status messages, and might cause a large number of running processes to build up on your site server.
