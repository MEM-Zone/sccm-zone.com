      <description>SQL licensing is always a pain but this report should make it a little easier…
Report release history
Previous report version

This is the second iteration of my SQL version report. When I look back on my previous work I always cringe and this was no exception. A while back, I received a request to add the SQL key to the report, so I began examining the old code.</description>

This method is valid for any application. In this case I will use the configuration manager client upgrade application. You might ask yourself, why not use the automatic client upgrade? Well, because the client upgrade can only run during a maintenance window. I won’t go into details, but unless this behavior changes, I cannot use this feature with my current configuration.</description>
